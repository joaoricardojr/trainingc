//This problem was suggested from a teacher at college, lets see if i can do it here
//First Programming Test:
//Weighted Average: Basic average problem, here we will recive 3 grades form a student, G1,G2 and G3
//and provide to each one a weight based on their order.
//and consider if he or she is aprooved or not if the final grade is 7 or more.
//Lets get to work!

//include <stdio.h>
//include <stdlib.h>
//include <string.h>

//Since we'r in C we have to include this Lib "string.h" to work with strings of chars

int main(float G1,G2,G3,WA; char name[32])
  {
   //as usual we alredy declared the variables in the main() function
   printf("Welcome to the grade calculator system, or as a like to call:\n GCS!\nThe first step is to input your name and then the 3 grades in the right order\nDon't messup with this!:\nName:");
   scanf("%s", &name);
   printf("Grade 1:")
   scanf("%f", &G1);
   printf("Grade 2:");
   scanf("%f", &G2);
   printf("Grade 3:");
   scanf("%f", &G3);
   //Now that we already read the variables from the users input guess is time to treat them
   G1=G1*2;
   G2=G2*4;
   G3=G3*4;
   //the weights are stndrd in the question so lets keep it that way
   WA=(G1+G2+G3)/6;
   printf("The Final Grade Of", name,"Was", WA);
   if(WA>=7)
   {
    printf("Aproved!");
   }else 
   if(WA<7)&&(WA>=5)
   {
    printf("In Recovery!");
   }else if(WA>0)&&(WA<5)
   {
    printf("Reproved!")
   }
   printf("Thanks for using the system, press enter to exit");
  }
